me, dear Virgil, across the void.

They rush fonNard in disbelief, wanting to grab at my feet, but fearing they will upset
my balance and knock me off. They beg now, in quiet desperation, but I have turned my
back. I know what I must do.

Beneath me, dizzyingly far beneath me, the red tile roofs spread out like a sea of ﬁre
on the countryside, illuminating the fair land upon which giants once roamed Giotto,
Donatello, Brunelleschi, Michelangelo, Botticelli.

I inch my toes to the edge.

“Come down!” they shout. “It’s not too late!”

0, willful ignorants! Do you not see the future? Do you not grasp the splendor of my
creation? The necessity?

I will gladly make this ultimate sacriﬁce and with it I will extinguish your ﬁnal hope
of ﬁnding what you seek.

You will never locate it in time.

Hundreds of feet below, the cobblestone piazza beckons like a tranquil oasis. How I
long for more time but time is the one commodity even my vast fortunes cannot afford.

In these ﬁnal seconds, I gaze down at the piazza, and I behold a sight that startles me.

I see your face.

You are gazing up at me from the shadows. Your eyes are mournful, and yet in them I
sense a veneration for what I have accomplished. You understand I have no choice. For
the love of Mankind, I must protect my masterpiece.

It grows even now waiting simmering beneath the bloodred waters of the lagoon
that reﬂects no stars.

And so, I lift my eyes from yours and I contemplate the horizon. High above this
burdened world, I make my ﬁnal supplication.

Dearest God, I pray the world remembers my name not as a monstrous sinner, but as
the glorious savior you know I truly am. I pray Mankind will understand the gift I leave
behind.

My gift is the future.

My gift is salvation.

My gift is Inferno.

With that, I whisper my amen and take my ﬁnal step, into the abyss.
