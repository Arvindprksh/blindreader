CHAPTER 1

THE MEMORIES MATERIALIZED slowly like bubbles surfacing from the darkness of a
bottomless well.

A veiled woman.

Robert Langdon gazed at her across a river whose churning waters ran red with blood.
On the far bank, the woman stood facing him, motionless, solemn, her face hidden by a
shroud. In her hand she gripped a blue tainia cloth, which she now raised in honor of the
sea of corpses at her feet. The smell of death hung everywhere.

Seek, the woman whispered. And ye shall ﬁnd.

Langdon heard the words as if she had spoken them inside his head. “Who are you?"
he called out, but his voice made no sound.

Time grows short, she whispered. Seek and ﬁnd.

Langdon took a step toward the river, but he could see the waters were bloodred and
too deep to traverse. When Langdon raised his eyes again to the veiled woman, the
bodies at her feet had multiplied. There were hundreds of them now, maybe thousands,
some still alive, writhing in agony, dying unthinkable deaths consumed by ﬁre, buried
in feces, devouring one another. He could hear the mournful cries of human suffering
echoing across the water.

The woman moved toward him, holding out her slender hands, as if beckoning for help.

“Who are you?!” Langdon again shouted.

In response, the woman reached up and slowly lifted the veil from her face. She was
strikingly beautiful, and yet older than Langdon had imagined—in her sixties perhaps,
stately and strong, like a timeless statue. She had a sternly set jaw, deep soulful eyes,
and long, silver-gray hair that cascaded over her shoulders in ringlets. An amulet of Iapis
lazuli hung around her neck—a single snake coiled around a staff.

Langdon sensed he knew her trusted her. But how? Why?

She pointed now to a writhing pair of legs, which protruded upside down from the
earth, apparently belonging to some poor soul who had been buried headﬁrst to his
waist. The man’s pale thigh bore a single letter—written in mud—R.

R? Langdon thought, uncertain. As in Robert? “Is that me?"

The woman’s face revealed nothing. Seek and ﬁnd, she repeated.

Without warning, she began radiating a white light brighter and brighter. Her entire
body started vibrating intensely, and then, in a rush of thunder, she exploded into a
thousand splintering shards of light.

Langdon bolted awake, shouting.

The room was bright. He was alone. The sharp smell of medicinal alcohol hung in the
air, and somewhere a machine pinged in quiet rhythm with his heart. Langdon tried to
move his right arm, but a sharp pain restrained him. He looked down and saw an N
tugging at the skin of his forearm.

His pulse quickened, and the machines kept pace, pinging more rapidly.
